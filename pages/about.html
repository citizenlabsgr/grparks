	<section>
		<p>This map show the parks of the City of Grand Rapids and the tax dollars invested in each one.</p>
		<h2>Types of parks</h2>
			<p>Notice by the layer gadget in the upper-right corner that there are four types of parks: Community, Neighborhood, Mini, and Urban. These are color-coordinated with the markers on the map, as well as with the list of parks on the left side.</p>
		<h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
			<p>The upper-right layer gadget also allows you to view neighborhood boundaries. When you select Neighborhoods, you will see a legend in the lower-left corner explaining the meaning of the various colors of the neighborhoods. Additionally, when you hover over (or "touch" on mobile devices) any neighborhood, that neighborhood's details will show in this legend.
		<h2>Wards</h2>
			<p>City government representational boundaries, aka wards, will show when this layer is selected. It works much like the neighborhood layer, explained above.</p>
